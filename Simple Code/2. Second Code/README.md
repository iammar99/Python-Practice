I created 2 calculators . Which perform basic Arithmatic operations like plus , minus , multiply and divide .
Both calculator work same but with different functions .

### Here is the differnece

- #### First Calculator 

  - Take input numbers and operator in different inputs
  - Solve Without FOR loop as all operators and operands are in different variable



- #### Second Calculator 

  - Take input numbers and operator in Same input
  - Solve With FOR loop as all operators and operands are in same variable
